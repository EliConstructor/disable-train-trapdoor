# Disable Train Trapdoor
A one mixin Fabric mod to disable the ability to interact with trapdoors on Create mod trains. Useful when using trapdoors as thinner walls for 3 block wide trains, becuase the trapdoors would keep getting opened on accident (or purpose) and end up hitting players off platforms when passing if they were standing too close.
This was my first time using mixins, I probably used them wrong, whoops.
